An Android application that detects `phishing` in incoming texts and alerts the user through `notification` in real time. The user may also examine the legitimacy of any message by accessing it in the app and viewing it in graphical form. Our API is powered by a dynamic `machine learning model` that improves over time as our consumers use it. Using `YouTube's API`, we also give the relevant spam videos that have been reported. The user receives a warning and has the option of reporting/forwarding any questionable messages to 1909.
